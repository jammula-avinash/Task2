    <p>
      This Mushroom Masala recipe is an easy, delicious Punjabi style one-pot
      mushroom Curry made with white button mushrooms in a spiced onion-tomato
      gravy. Though I have made the curry in a pan, I also cover Instant Pot
      instructions after my step-by-step guide below and in the recipe card.
