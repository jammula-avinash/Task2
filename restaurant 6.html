    <p>
      Kaju curry is a restaurant style delicious recipe of a creamy kaju butter
      masala with a rich, tangy, sweet flavorful gravy made with cashews,
      tomatoes, cream and spices. Kaju is the Hindi word for cashews. This
      recipe of kaju masala has an overload of cashews as they are added twice
      during the cooking process. Serve with roti, naan, paratha or steamed rice
      for a sumptuous and filling lunch or dinner.
